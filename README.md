- 👋 Hi, I’m @Daniel
- 👀 I develop web and mobile applications using: React Native, React.js, Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js, TailwindCSS, and Redux.
- 👀 I am a highly skilled developer with expertise in React Native, React, Redux, Next.js, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS, but not limited to that tech stack. And I have helped many clients to integrate third-party API and serverless functions such as Strapi, Sanity, Netlify, Weather API, Google API, YouTube API, etc in both React.Js and Next.Js web applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a viable project
